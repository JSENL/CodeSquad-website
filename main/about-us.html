    	We see two challenges
    </h1>

    <!-- <div class="width80 center"> -->
    <p class="width80 center">
    	CodeSquad was created to address two challenges: the need for good jobs and the need for good programmers.  The need for good jobs is well-established, with a <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2016/03/15/nearly-half-of-boston-residents-make-less-than-35000-a-year">recent report</a> telling us that half of Boston lives on less than $35,000 per year, and unemployment is stuck around 12% in neighborhoods like Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattapan, despite improvements in the wider economy.  
    </p>
    <p class="width80 center">
    	But there is another problem: companies around Boston, and across the United States, need more programmers.  In an influential 2011 <em>Wall Street Journal</em> editorial, Netscape's Marc Andreessen said "<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software is eating the world</a>." More and more businesses are being run on software and delivered as online services, from movies to agriculture to national defense.  And as businesses use more and more software, they need more and more programmers to write, test and maintain those applications.
    </p>
    <p class="width80 center">
    	But they are running out of talent.  A July 2017 <a href="http://skill-works.org/documents/BBJViewPointLtEAug2017.pdf">report</a> from Skill-Works and The Boston Foundation found that in Greater Boston, for every 17 job openings in IT, there was only 1 qualified applicant.  Not just technology companies, but health care providers, manufacturers and financial services firms are all desperate for more software talent.
    </p>
    <p class="width80 center">
    	CodeSquad seeks to balance this equation by providing full-stack web development training to talented adults from low-income families in Greater Boston, and work to place them in software internships.
